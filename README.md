# Tic-Tac-Toe

## discription
Created a iphone tic-tac-toe game so that i can learn about the basics of created ios applications.

Native to iphone 8.

### issues/bugs
- need to add restrictions so that the game scales to iphones with different resolutions/screen sizes.

### Todo:
- Add a menu
- add a end game menu
- create a HUD to keep track of winnings
- refactor the game by creating a struct or obj to handle the game
- animate a line being drawn through the 3 in a row or animate a tic tac toe
